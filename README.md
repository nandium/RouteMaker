## Features

### Drawing Board for Routes

In rock climbing/ bouldering, seasoned climbers tend to make routes for one another with unrelated handholds in the gym. One route can be as long as ordered/ unordered 10-30 moves which can include memorization of both handholds and footholds. One way is to draw them out on handphone but it is difficult to point out the exact holds with fat fingers. Labeling the exact order of moves can be troublesome too.

By utilizing Object Detection, this application takes in :camera: pictures of climbing walls and provides the handholds as interactable buttons to make the route creation process easier.

### Route Sharing System

Users can upload the routes that they created so that other climbers in the same gyms can try out too. Since climbing grades have subjective aspects to them, people can also grade each other's routes to produce a more accurate assessment. Fun and interesting routes can be upvoted so that more people will take notice. If there are interesting betas to a problem, users can mention them in the comments too.
