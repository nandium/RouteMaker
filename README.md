In rock climbing/ bouldering, seasoned climbers tend to make routes for one another with unrelated handholds in the gym. One route can be as long as ordered/ unordered 10-30 moves which can include memorization of both handholds and footholds. One way is to draw them out on handphone but it is difficult to point out the exact holds with fat fingers. Labeling the exact order of moves can be troublesome too.

By utilizing Object Detection, this application takes in :camera: pictures of climbing walls and provides the handholds as interactable buttons to make the route creation process easier.

## Ongoing Work

A route sharing system where users can view, grade, vote, comment on each other routes.
