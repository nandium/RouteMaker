      Personally, when people make routes for me at the gym, I tend to forget
      half of the moves with my goldfish memory.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      One way to solve this is to label out the routes on mobile, but circling
      and numbering them takes too much time too.

    <hr class="my-4" />
    <p class="lead">1. Upload the photo of a climbing wall</p>
    <p class="lead">2. Label the holds as handholds or footholds</p>
    <p class="lead">3. Export it to share with friends</p>
